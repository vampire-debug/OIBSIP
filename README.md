This repository contains the Java-based projects I developed as part of the Java Development Internship at Oasis Infobyte. The projects demonstrate core Java programming skills, object-oriented principles, and basic problem-solving approaches.

Project 1: Guess the Number Game

The Guess the Number Game is a simple console-based game where the system randomly generates a number, and the user has to guess it within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the system provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low.

Features:

Generates a random number between 1 and 100.

Allows multiple attempts to guess the number.

Provides feedback on each guess (higher/lower).

Displays the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.


How it works:

The user inputs a guess.

The system checks if the guess matches the number.

If not, it provides a hint (too high or too low) until the correct number is guessed.





Project 2: ATM Interface

The ATM Interface simulates basic ATM functionalities such as account balance inquiry, withdrawal, deposit, and transaction history. It is designed as a command-line interface with simple inputs and outputs.

Features:

Check Balance: View the current account balance.

Deposit Funds: Add money to the account.

Withdraw Funds: Withdraw money from the account if sufficient balance is available.

Transaction History: Display the record of past transactions.

Exit: Close the session.


How it works:

The user is prompted to log in.

Once logged in, the user can choose various operations such as viewing balance, withdrawing, or depositing funds.

Transaction history is updated after each transaction.





Project 3: Online Examination System

The Online Examination System is a console-based application that simulates a basic examination interface. It allows users to log in, answer multiple-choice questions, track their remaining time with a countdown, and submit the exam automatically when time runs out.

Features:

Login: User authentication with username and password.

MCQ Selection: Presents a set of multiple-choice questions for the user to answer.

Timer and Auto Submit: The exam session runs on a timer, and answers are submitted automatically when the time is up.

Profile Management: Users can update their name and password after logging in.


How it works:

After logging in, the user can answer MCQs.

A countdown timer is displayed, and when time runs out, the exam is auto-submitted.

The system also allows users to update their profiles before starting the exam.
